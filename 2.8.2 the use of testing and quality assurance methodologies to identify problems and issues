Resulting service (final product) 

When a game is near completion it needs to opened by other types of testing.  

Beta testing is a huge part of it where it is used by members of the public and groups of end users. It is a form of “user acceptance testing (AUT)” 

Traditional beta testing – given to customers/ end user and tested 

Public – given to select groups to test and feedback 

Technical – given to groups of employees to test 

Focused – Only sections of the solution are given for testing 

Post-realise – The product goes live and data is collected and then used for improvement
