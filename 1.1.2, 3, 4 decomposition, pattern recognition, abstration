4 techniques, known as pillars, that are utilised as a part of computational thinking 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decomposition – breaking down problems into smaller parts 

Pattern recognition 

Abstraction 

Algorithms

Decomposition  
--------------
Benefits 

  Deep level of understanding for your problem 
  
  Different people can work on different parts of the problem 
  
  Test and maintain different components separately 

Drawbacks 

  Too much breaking down can mean that when it is put back together, it doesn’t fix the problem. Break it more. 

4 steps of decomposition 
------------------------
  Identify problem 
  
  Break it down 
  
  Describe modules 
  
  communicate 

 

example – video game 

identify the problem - the character models arm breaks when it grabs an item 

break it down – the model has no grab animation to default too, its arm just goes towards the item from any distance. 

Describe modules – make a grab animation for the model, make the character only to be able to grab an item when within range to grab it.  

Communicate – communicate with the modelling team to make a grab model.

Pattern recognition 
-------------------
Recognising similarities within something eg chests in video games usually means theres loots in it. Or the yellow paint to tell you where to go. 

Pattern recognition can be used in many forms.  

Looking for patterns or trends in data to identify solutions.  

+ efficiency 

+ accurate predictions based on previous data 

Only predictions 

Steps of pattern recognition 
----------------------------
  Identifying and interpreting common elements in problems or systems  
  
  Identifying individual elements in the patterns 
  
  Describing patterns that have been identified 
  
  Making predictions based on identified patterns 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstraction 

Filtering/ ignoring irrelevant information
