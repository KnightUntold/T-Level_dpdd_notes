 

Before a text file can be used: 

  If the file doesn’t already exist it must be created  f = open("file.txt", 'x') 
  
  It must be opened for writing f = open("file.txt", 'w')  
  
  Data must be written to the file f.write("text here") 
  
  It must be closed once data has been written to the file f.close() 

Once the text file is created, it can be read by: 

  Opening it for reading   f = open("file.txt", 'r') 
  
  Reading the data print(f.read()) 
  
  Closing the file f.close() 

 

'w+' In python if a file doesn’t exist. It needs to be created before we can write data onto it. 'w+' allows for a file to be created then written on.  

 

x= open('file.txt', 'w+') 

x.write('hello world') 

x.close() 

 

y= open('file.txt', 'r') 

Print(y.read()) 

y.close()
