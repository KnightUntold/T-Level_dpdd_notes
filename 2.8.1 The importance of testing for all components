Software testing 

Does it meet the requirements? 

Is it bug free? – working on bug fixes early can save money and time 

 

Software testing is the “verification of the application under test” (AUT) 

 

Benefits gained: 

  Security 
  
  Cost effective 
  
  Product quality 
  
  Customer satisfaction (UX) 
  
  Compatibility testing 
  
  Covers many aspects to ensure all parts are working together 



Types include: 

  Hardware 
  
  OS 
  
  Software 
  
  Network 
  
  Browsers 
  
  Devices 
  
  Mobile 
  
  Software versions 
  
  Data

Hardware 

  Important to test as many variations as possible 
  
  Should also backwards compatibility test to ensure if older hardware is compatible 
  
  And also forward compatibility test to ensure newer hardware is compatible as new hardware is released 

 

Operating systems 
  
  Customers / end users use a variety of platforms 
  
  Important that you test the platform they suggest and have told you 
  
  If you are developing “cross platform”, which is often web/ java/ python you need to make sure its compatible. 

 

Software 

  Your solution may require other software to work 
  
  Someone else’s might need yours to work 
  
  You need to test that they are working together effectively 

 

Network 

  If your solution uses network features, its important to make sure they are communicating properly.  
  
  Also important to check the bandwidth requirements of your solutions and check for inefficiencies 
  
  Also needs to be checked on different network types and speeds (WIFI, internet, ethernet)  

 

Browser 

  Is your solution is web based then the browser has to be compatible 
  
  Most users use chrome or edge which need slightly different html implementations 
  
  You have to accommodate for then just the most common (Firefox, brave, internet explorer) should be considered as well as mobile versions of browsers too. 

 

Devices 

  To check the compatibility of a wide range of devices. 
  
  In the most part drivers are built into the OS should deal with it. However you still need to make sure its working and some devices wont be compatible with it.  

 

Mobile 

  If you are developing cross platform, a mobile version will most likely be needed 
  
  Needs to suitable for iOS and android and even in some cases old windows ce devices 
  
  Should allow for a variety of input systems (touchscreen, Bluetooth, voice etc) and for both portrait and landscape usage effectively.  

 

Software versions  

  End users devices may have all sorts of versions of other software, which yours has to work with so its important to make sure they can work together and work with a mast majority of software versions.  

 

 

Data 

  All manor of data needs to be used to test the solution. 

Normal, erroneous, extreme and boundary data are all data types that should be used to test the system to ensure robustness and compliance.
