top-down 
---------
breaking down the main problem into smaller sub problems 

plan everything out before you start coding 

benefits 

  easy to visualise all components 

  Easier to manage and prepare 

  Reduces complexity 

Drawbacks 

  Redundancies 
  
  Takes longer to plan 
  
  Not flexible 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bottom-up 
---------
solving smaller problems and integrating the into a bigger solution 

benefits 

  flexible 
  
  parallel development 
  
  code reusability 

Drawbacks 

  problems integrating systems 
  
  complexity 
  
  lack of focus 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

modularisation 
--------------
benefits 

  elements can be given to different programmers to speed up processes 
  
  individual debugging is more effective 
  
  programmers can be given parts of the problem that they are specialised in 

drawbacks 

  assumes you know everything in advance  

not always appropriate with event-driven programming
