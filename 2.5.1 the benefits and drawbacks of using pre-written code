 

Places to get prewritten code: 

  Built in libraries; https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html 
  
  Third party Libraries; https://numpy.org/ 
  
  Open source frameworks; python 
  
  Repurposing code that has been written internally 

 

Benefits 

  Shorter development time 
  
  Improved end product – efficiency, security, improved maintainability 
  
  Lower staffing requirements – not always, but potentially  

 

Drawbacks 

  Clashing code/ syntax 
  
  Harder to understand 
  
  Security 
  
  Over reliance on libraries  
  
  Not always efficient or trustworthy results 

  Lack of control on pre-written impacts in your code
